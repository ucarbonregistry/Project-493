PRIOR HISTORY CDM
________
1. The project activity initially submitted a Prior Consideration under the Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) of the UNFCCC for registration on 03/04/2015 (LINK: https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/PriorCDM/notifications/index_html?s=1340
). However, the project
proponent did not pursue CDM registration afterward. Another project activity was
submitted for prior consideration under CDM for registration on 01/10/2015 (LINK: 
2 https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/PriorCDM/notifications/index_html?s=1220), which is different from the current project activity. The project is now being applied under UCR to issue carbon credits and receive carbon financing.

2. The project has not been applied under any other greenhouse gas (GHG) mechanism except
for CDM. Additionally, for any period under UCR, CDM validation and verifications have
not been conducted, and no credits have been issued. Therefore, the project will not cause
double accounting of carbon credits (i.e., COUs).
